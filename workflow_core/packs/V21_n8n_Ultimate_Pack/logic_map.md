Creating a logic map for a complex enterprise n8n automation pack involves understanding the various automation tasks and their relationships. Here's a basic example of how such a map might look like:

1. Trigger: Start with the event that triggers the automation pack. This could be a new email in a specified inbox, a new entry in a database, a schedule, a webhook, or any other event that n8n can monitor.

2. Decision 1: Based on the trigger, the automation pack might need to make a decision. For example, if the trigger is a new email, the decision might be based on the content or sender of the email. If it's a new database entry, the decision might be based on the data in the entry.

3. Action 1: Depending on the decision, the automation pack might take one or more actions. This could include sending an email, updating a database, calling an API, or any other action that n8n can perform.

4. Decision 2: After the first action, there might be another decision point. For example, if the first action was to send an email, the second decision might be based on whether the email was successfully sent.

5. Action 2: Depending on the second decision, there might be more actions. For example, if the email was not successfully sent, the automation pack might attempt to send it again, or it might send a notification to a system administrator.

6. Loop: In some cases, the automation pack might loop back to a previous decision or action. For example, if the email is not successfully sent after several attempts, the automation pack might loop back to the initial trigger and start the process again.

7. End: Eventually, the automation pack will reach an end point. This might be after a certain action has been successfully completed, or after a certain number of loops.

This is a simplified example, and a real-world enterprise n8n automation pack might include many more decisions, actions, and loops. The key to creating a logic map is to understand how these elements are connected and how data flows between them.

1. AI-Based Decision Making Node: This advanced node would integrate with the V21 system to provide logic-based AI decision making. It would use APIs to pull data from various sources and then use AI algorithms to analyze the data and make decisions based on the analysis. This could be used in a variety of applications, from automating business processes to providing personalized recommendations to users.

2. Real-Time Data Processing Node: This node would use APIs to pull real-time data from various sources, process it using advanced logic algorithms, and then output the results in a format that can be used by other parts of the V21 system. This could be used for things like real-time analytics, monitoring, and alerting.

3. Machine Learning Integration Node: This advanced node would integrate with various machine learning platforms via their APIs. It would use logic to determine what data to send to the machine learning platform, how to interpret the results, and what actions to take based on those results. This could be used for predictive analytics, automated decision making, and other advanced AI tasks.

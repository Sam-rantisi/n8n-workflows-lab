As an AI model, I don't have real-time data and I can't track the version updates of any software. As of my training data up to September 2021, I can't provide information on V13 of an enterprise n8n automation workflow. However, n8n is a workflow automation tool that helps you to connect anything to everything via its open, fair-code model. It allows you to automate tasks, create custom integrations, and get more out of your data by connecting and automating various services and tools. For the latest version updates about n8n, you should check their official website or get in touch with their support.

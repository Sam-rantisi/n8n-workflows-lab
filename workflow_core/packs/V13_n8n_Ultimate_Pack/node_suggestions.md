1. Predictive Analysis Node: This node would use machine learning and statistical models to predict future behavior based on past data. Its logic could involve regression analysis, decision trees, or neural networks, and it could integrate APIs like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn for building and training models.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Node: This node would analyze and understand human language, enabling the system to interact with users in a more intuitive way. Its logic could involve techniques like tokenization, named entity recognition, or sentiment analysis, and it could integrate APIs like Google Cloud's NLP or IBM's Watson for language processing.

3. Blockchain Verification Node: This node would verify transactions or other data using blockchain technology. Its logic could involve cryptographic hashing and proof-of-work or proof-of-stake systems, and it could integrate APIs like Bitcoin's or Ethereum's for interacting with their respective blockchains.

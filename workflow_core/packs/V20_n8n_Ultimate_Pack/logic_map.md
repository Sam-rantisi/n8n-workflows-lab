Creating a logic map for a complex enterprise n8n automation pack involves defining processes, dependencies, and interactions among various automation tasks. Here is a simple logic map:

1. Start:
   - Trigger: The automation process starts when a specific event occurs. For example, a new customer record is added to the CRM.

2. Task 1: Data Retrieval
   - The automation pack retrieves the data from the CRM system.
   - Dependencies: None
   - Interaction: Sends data to Task 2

3. Task 2: Data Processing
   - The automation pack processes the data, for example, it might validate the data or perform some calculations.
   - Dependencies: Requires data from Task 1
   - Interaction: Sends processed data to Task 3 and Task 4

4. Task 3: Data Storage
   - The automation pack stores the processed data in a database or another system.
   - Dependencies: Requires processed data from Task 2
   - Interaction: Sends confirmation of data storage to Task 5

5. Task 4: Notification
   - The automation pack sends a notification to a user or system about the status of the data processing.
   - Dependencies: Requires processed data from Task 2
   - Interaction: None

6. Task 5: Error Handling
   - The automation pack handles any errors occurred during the process.
   - Dependencies: Requires confirmation from Task 3 and any error messages from all other tasks
   - Interaction: If an error occurs, it triggers a notification (Task 4)

7. End:
   - The automation process ends.

This is a simplified logic map, and actual enterprise-level automation may involve more complex processes, multiple dependencies, and interactions. Please adjust the map according to your specific needs.

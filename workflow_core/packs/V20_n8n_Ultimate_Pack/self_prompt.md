Based on the critique, V21's prompt should be:

"Refactor the workflow to eliminate repetition, consolidate nodes, and improve clarity. Specifically, consider the following:

1. Consolidate the multiple HTTP Request nodes targeting the same URL ("https://api.example.com/data") into a single node, unless different parameters or headers need to be passed with each request.

2. Reduce the number of Supabase Insert nodes targeting the same "events" table, unless different data is being inserted each time.

3. Rename nodes to clearly reflect their functions within the workflow. Avoid names like "HTTP Request_v17_v18_v19_v20" and "Supabase Insert_v16_v17_v18_v19_v20".

4. Evaluate the Set node to determine if it should include more information beyond setting the status to "processed".

5. Clarify the purpose and expected data of the webhook node that triggers with the path "v20-trigger".

Remember to document the refactored workflow clearly to ensure that its purpose and function are easily understood by others."

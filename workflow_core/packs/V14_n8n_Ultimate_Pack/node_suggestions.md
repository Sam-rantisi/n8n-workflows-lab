1. Fraud Detection Node: This node will use machine learning algorithms coupled with historical transaction data to detect potential fraudulent activities. It can utilize APIs from various data sources to gather real-time data to make predictions. It may also incorporate logic to send alerts or block transactions based on a certain threshold of suspicion.

2. User Verification Node: This node will integrate with APIs such as those offered by identity verification services. It will use logic to verify the identity of users during crucial operations like transactions, ensuring a high level of security. It can also have built-in safeguards to protect against common security threats like identity theft and phishing.

3. Personalized Recommendation Node: This node will use APIs to gather user data and employ machine learning algorithms to make personalized recommendations. The logic will be built to analyze user behavior and preferences to suggest products, services, or content that align with their interests. For example, it can be used in e-commerce platforms to increase user engagement and sales.

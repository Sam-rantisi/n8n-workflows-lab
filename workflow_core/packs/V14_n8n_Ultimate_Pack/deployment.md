Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- A Render account
- A Supabase account
- An n8n account

Here are the steps for deploying an n8n automation pack using Render and Supabase:

1. **Set up Supabase:**

   - Log in to your Supabase account.
   - Create a new project and note down the `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from your project settings.
   - Set up the table you need for your automation in the Supabase database.

2. **Set up n8n:**

   - Log in to your n8n account.
   - Create your automation workflow and save it.

3. **Set up Render:**

   - Log in to your Render account.
   - Create a new Web Service.
   - In the "Environment" section, select "Docker" as your environment.
   - In the "Build Command" field, enter `n8n start --tunnel`.
   - In the "Start Command" field, enter `n8n start`.
   - Add your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as environment variables.

4. **Deploy your n8n workflow:**

   - Go back to your n8n account and export your workflow.
   - In your Render account, go to your Web Service and select the "Deployments" tab.
   - Click on "New Deployment" and upload your n8n workflow.
   - Click "Deploy" to start the deployment.
   - Once the deployment is completed, you can access your n8n workflow from the URL provided by Render.

5. **Test your automation:**

   - Access your n8n workflow from the URL provided by Render.
   - Click on "Execute Workflow" to test your automation.
   - Check your Supabase database to see if the automation worked correctly.

Remember to regularly monitor your automation and make sure it is working as expected.

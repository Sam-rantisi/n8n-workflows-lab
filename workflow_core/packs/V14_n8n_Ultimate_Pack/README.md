V14 of an enterprise n8n automation workflow represents the 14th version of the workflow in n8n, a fair-code licensed process automation tool. This version would likely include improvements, bug fixes, and potentially new features to enhance the automation capabilities. It could include more complex workflows, better UI/UX, and enhanced integration with various enterprise tools. However, as of my current knowledge, there's no specific information available for a "V14" of n8n. It's important to check the official n8n resources or get in touch with their support for the most accurate information.

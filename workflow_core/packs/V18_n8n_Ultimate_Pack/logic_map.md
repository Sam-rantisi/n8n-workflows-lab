Creating a logic map for a complex enterprise n8n automation pack involves understanding the workflows and processes involved in the automation pack. Below is a general outline:

1. Inputs/Triggers: 
   - Define what initiates the automation process. This could be an incoming email, a new entry in a database, a scheduled time, or any other triggers provided by n8n.

2. Data Processing:
   - Define how the data from the input is processed. This could involve parsing the data, transforming it, or running it through certain algorithms. 

3. Decision Points:
   - Identify points in the process where decisions need to be made. This could involve checking if certain conditions are met, like if a certain value is above or below a threshold.

4. Actions:
   - Define what actions are taken based on the data processing and decision points. This could involve sending an email, updating a database, or running a script.

5. Outputs/Results:
   - Define what the end result of the automation process is. This could be a report, an updated database, or any other output.

6. Error Handling:
   - Plan for how errors will be handled. This could involve sending an error report, retrying the process, or stopping the process altogether.

7. Feedback Loops:
   - Identify any feedback loops in the process. This could involve using the output of the process as an input for another process.

8. Dependencies:
   - Identify any dependencies between different parts of the process. This could involve one process needing to complete before another can begin.

9. Iteration/Repetition:
   - Determine if any parts of the process need to be repeated. This could involve looping through a list of items or repeating a process until a certain condition is met.

This logic map should be adjusted based on the specific workflows and processes in the n8n automation pack.

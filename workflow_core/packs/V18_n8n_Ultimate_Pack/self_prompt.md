Based on the critique, V19's prompt should be: "Please revise the n8n workflow to address the following suggestions: 

1. Eliminate unnecessary repetition of nodes with the same purpose, such as the multiple HTTP Request nodes and Supabase Insert nodes.
2. Adopt a more descriptive and meaningful node naming convention.
3. Reorder the nodes to follow a more logical workflow, starting with the 'Start' node.
4. Clarify the use of the 'status' field in the 'Set' node and ensure its use in the workflow.
5. Reframe the webhook path to be more indicative of its function.
6. Reconsider the connection logic, specifically the connection between the 'Supabase Insert' and 'HTTP Request' nodes.
7. Remove unused nodes to streamline the workflow.

The goal is to create a cleaner, more efficient, and logical workflow with clear naming and ordering."

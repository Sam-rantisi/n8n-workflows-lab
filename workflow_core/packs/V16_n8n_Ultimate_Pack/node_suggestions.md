1. Machine Learning Integration Node: This advanced node would use AI/ML algorithms to analyze the data processed by V16. It would leverage APIs to integrate machine learning platforms such as Google's TensorFlow or Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning. The logic in this node would involve training models based on the data processed by V16 and using these models to make predictions or decisions.

2. Real-time Analytics Node: This node would use logic to analyze data in real-time, allowing for immediate insights and decision-making. It would use APIs to integrate with real-time analytics platforms like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis. The logic in this node would involve processing and analyzing data in real-time and triggering actions based on the insights derived.

3. IoT Integration Node: This advanced node would connect V16 with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, collecting data from them for further processing. It would use APIs to communicate with IoT platforms such as AWS IoT Core or Google's Cloud IoT Core. The logic in this node would involve collecting and processing data from IoT devices, and making decisions based on this data.

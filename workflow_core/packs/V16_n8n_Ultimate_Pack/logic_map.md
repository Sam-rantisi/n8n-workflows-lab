Creating a logic map for an n8n automation pack involves outlining the flow of data, the triggers, actions, and operations in the automation process. Here's a simplified example:

1. Start Node (Trigger): This is where the automation process starts. It could be a certain time of the day, a new data entry in a database, a new email in an inbox, etc.

2. Data Extraction Nodes: These nodes are responsible for pulling the necessary data needed for the automation process. This could involve API calls, database queries, or reading from files.

3. Data Processing Nodes: These nodes manipulate and process the extracted data. This could involve calculations, data formatting, filtering, etc.

4. Decision Nodes: These nodes make decisions based on the processed data. They can route the flow of the automation to different paths based on certain conditions.

5. Action Nodes: These nodes perform actions based on the decisions made. This could involve sending emails, updating databases, making API calls, etc.

6. Error Handling Nodes: These nodes handle any errors that may occur during the automation process. They can send notifications about the error, log the error, or even attempt to correct the error.

7. End Node: This node signifies the end of the automation process.

This logic map can be visualized as a flowchart with arrows connecting each node to represent the flow of data and actions. Of course, the complexity of the logic map will depend on the specifics of the automation pack. 

Remember that in n8n, you can create multiple connections from one node to another, enabling you to create complex workflows with multiple branches.

Creating a logic map for a complex enterprise n8n automation pack would involve outlining the different processes and tasks that need to be automated, as well as the conditions and logical flows that determine how these tasks are executed. Here's a generic example:

1. Start Node: This is the entry point of the workflow. It triggers the automation process when certain conditions are met, such as a specific time of day or when a new data entry is made.

2. Data Collection Nodes: These nodes are responsible for gathering the necessary data from various sources. This could include retrieving customer data from a CRM system, downloading files from a cloud storage service, or pulling data from a database.

  - Condition Node: Checks if the data collected is valid or meets certain criteria. For example, it could check if a customer has made a purchase within the last month.

3. Processing Nodes: These nodes perform actions on the collected data. This could involve processing a payment, sending an email, or updating a database.

  - Function Node: Performs complex operations or calculations on the data.

4. Decision Nodes: These nodes determine the next step based on the results of the previous actions. For example, if a payment was successful, the workflow could move onto the next step. If not, it could trigger an error notification.

5. Action Nodes: Depending on the decisions made, these nodes execute specific actions. This can include sending notifications, updating records, or triggering other workflows.

6. End Node: This is the final step of the workflow, which could involve logging the results of the automation, sending a final report, or simply ending the workflow.

Remember, this is just a generic example. The actual logic map would depend on the specific processes and tasks you want to automate in your enterprise.

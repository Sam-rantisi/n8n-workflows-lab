1. Intelligent Decision Making Node: This node will use logic and API to make intelligent decisions based on the input data. This could include sorting through data, identifying patterns, and making predictions. The node could use machine learning algorithms to improve its decision-making capabilities over time.

2. Data Integration Node: This node will use APIs to gather data from different sources and integrate it into a unified format. The node will use logic to determine how to best integrate the data, resolving any conflicts or inconsistencies in the data.

3. Real-Time Data Processing Node: This node will use APIs to gather real-time data, such as social media posts or financial market data, and process it in real-time. The node will use logic to determine how to best process the data, identifying key trends or anomalies in the data.

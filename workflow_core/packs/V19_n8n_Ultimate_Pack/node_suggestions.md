1. User Verification Node: This node can be designed to verify the user's identity before allowing them to access certain features of the application. It can do so by integrating with third-party identity verification APIs like Jumio or Onfido. The logic part of the node will be used to determine what actions to take based on the verification result.

2. Weather Forecast Node: This node can provide weather updates by integrating with weather APIs like OpenWeatherMap or Weatherbit. The logic part of the node can be used to interpret the data from the API and provide the user with relevant information such as the current temperature, weather conditions, and forecasts for the next few days.

3. Payment Processing Node: This node can handle transactions by integrating with payment gateway APIs like Stripe or PayPal. The logic part of the node can be used to validate the user's payment information, process the payment, and handle any errors that may occur during the transaction.

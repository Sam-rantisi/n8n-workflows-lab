Creating a logic map for a complex enterprise n8n automation pack will be a visual representation of how different components interact with each other. Here is a high-level conceptual map:

1. **Trigger Node**: This is the initial point of the automation process. It could be a time-based trigger (e.g., every Monday at 9 am), an event-based trigger (e.g., when a new email arrives), or a manual trigger.

2. **Data Input Nodes**: These nodes fetch data from different sources needed for the automation process. For instance, data might be fetched from an API, a database, a CRM system, or an excel file.

3. **Data Processing Nodes**: These nodes process the data fetched by the input nodes. This could involve filtering, sorting, calculating, or transforming data.

4. **Decision Nodes**: These nodes make decisions based on the processed data. For instance, if an email contains certain keywords, it could be routed to a specific department.

5. **Action Nodes**: These nodes perform actions based on the decisions made. Actions could include sending an email, updating a database, or making a post on social media.

6. **Output Nodes**: These nodes handle the output of the automation process. They could involve writing data to a file, sending a notification, or posting a message to a team chat.

7. **Error Handling Nodes**: These nodes manage any errors that occur during the automation process. They could involve sending an email to an administrator, logging the error to a file, or retrying a failed operation.

8. **Monitoring and Logging Nodes**: These nodes monitor the performance of the automation process and log important events. They could involve creating a dashboard, generating a report, or sending a daily summary email.

Each node in the map is connected with arrows indicating the flow of data and control. The map might also include loops (for repeating actions), branches (for making choices), and parallel paths (for performing actions simultaneously).

Based on the critique, V20's prompt should be:

"Revise the current workflow to optimize efficiency and readability. Remove redundant nodes that perform identical HTTP requests to the same URL and store the result of one request for reuse. Improve node naming conventions by naming nodes based on their function rather than using confusing versioning suffixes. Simplify the data flow to have a clear, linear progression from start to finish and remove unused nodes like the "Set" Node and "Webhook" node. Consolidate multiple Supabase Insert nodes performing the same action into a single node. Incorporate error handling to ensure the workflow can handle unexpected situations. Lastly, add comments to explain what each part of the workflow does for better understanding and maintenance."

Revise the n8n workflow to simplify the process and increase efficiency. Ensure that node names are clear and indicative of their function, and eliminate redundant nodes. Address the issue of circular loops to prevent potential infinite loops. Incorporate error handling to manage potential failures with HTTP requests or data insertion into Supabase. Clarify the purpose and use of the "Set" and "Webhook" nodes. Streamline the workflow to avoid repetitive actions, and consider using a variable for the URL in the HTTP request to avoid manual updates if the URL changes.

Creating a logic map for a complex enterprise n8n automation pack requires understanding of the various components involved and their interactions. Here's a simplified version of how it might look:

1. **Input Data**: This is the starting point of the automation process. It could be data from a CRM system, social media feeds, emails, etc. 

2. **Data Processing Nodes**: These are the n8n nodes that process the input data. They may perform operations like filtering, sorting, merging, or transforming the data.

3. **Decision Nodes**: These nodes are responsible for making decisions based on the processed data. For example, if an email contains certain keywords, it may be forwarded to a specific department.

4. **Action Nodes**: These nodes perform actions based on the decisions made. They might send emails, update CRM records, post to social media, etc.

5. **Output Nodes**: These nodes handle the final output of the automation process. They might save the results to a database, generate reports, or send notifications.

Here is a logic map representation:

```
Input Data 
    |
    v
Data Processing Nodes 
    |
    v
Decision Nodes
    |
    v
Action Nodes
    |
    v
Output Nodes
```

This flow might loop back to the start or branch at several points depending on the complexity of the automation pack. Please note that the exact nodes and their arrangement will vary based on the specific automation task being performed.
